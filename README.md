This project is very easy to exectue first we need to install raylib and npp and then just copy paste the given code in npp then you can run it.
I am putting 2 songs as example U(unit i found you) and hw(Heatwaves).
After runnging the code for first time a user input file will be created so next time while opening the media player u can directly put the song in user input file instead of writing it's name when you run the program 
The song's are arranged by timesplayed (High to low )
